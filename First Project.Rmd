Dear CEO & CFO of Budweiser the purpose of this explanatory data analysis is to conduct analysis from multiple different angles, and make inferences based on the Beers and Breweries data sets that were provided. We hope that this will fuel data driven decisions on future beer launches and beers that might need to be refreshed.

```



QUESTION 1
How many Breweries are present in each state?

Using the bar chart along with the heat map you can see and visualize the number of breweries per state. You can see that California and Colorado seem to have the most Breweries while states such as North Dakota and West Virginia have just one brewery.
```{r}
#Check if any rows are missing the State in Breweries Data set
gg_miss_var(Breweries)

Breweriesperstate = count(Breweries, State) #Count the number of breweries per state
names(Breweriesperstate) = c('State', 'Number of Breweries') #Change the column names
Breweriesperstate$State = str_remove_all(Breweriesperstate$State, "\\s") #Remove white spaces
head(Breweriesperstate) #Verify data

#Get a visual representation of Breweries per state
Breweriesperstate %>% filter(!is.na(State)) %>% ggplot(aes(State, `Number of Breweries`, fill = State)) + 
  geom_col(color = "black") + geom_text(aes(label = `Number of Breweries`), vjust = -0.5) + 
  labs(title = 'Number of Breweries Per State', x = 'State', y = 'Number of Breweries') + 
  theme_economist()

#USMap of Breweries in each state
country = data.frame(State = state.abb, region = state.name) #Pull in states data set
head(country) #Verify data set

BPSmergedcountry = merge(Breweriesperstate, country, 'State') #Merge to have the region 
head(BPSmergedcountry) #Verify data set

states = map_data('state') #Get the data with longitudes and latitudes
states$region = str_to_title(states$region) #Capitalize the first letter in the region
head(states) #Verify data set

statescenter = data.frame(state.center, State = state.abb, state.region, state.name) #Get the states centers
head(statescenter) #Verify data set
BPSmergedstatescenter = merge(BPSmergedcountry, statescenter, 'State') #Merge to have the state centers
head(BPSmergedstatescenter) #Verify data set

map.df = merge(BPSmergedcountry, states, 'region') #Merge to have the longitude and latitudes on same data set
map.df <- map.df[order(map.df$order),] #Set the order for proper plotting
head(map.df) #Verify data set
dim(map.df) #Verify dimensions for number of rows and columns

#Plot the map showing the number of breweries by state
map.df %>% ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + geom_polygon(aes(fill = `Number of Breweries`)) + 
  geom_path(color = "black") + scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(heat.colors(10)),na.value="grey90") + 
  ggtitle("Number of Breweries by State") + coord_map() + xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") + 
  with(BPSmergedstatescenter, annotate(geom = "text", x = x, y = y, label = state.name, size = 3)) + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```



QUESTION 2
Merge beer data with the breweries data. 
Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.

Using the head function, we were able to see the first 6 observations. We were also able to see the last 6 observation using the tail function.
```{r}
#Merge Beers and Breweries datasets
BBmerged = merge(Beers, Breweries, by.x = c("Brewery_id"), by.y = c("Brew_ID"))
dim(Beers) #See number of rows in original dataset
dim(BBmerged) #Verify that the number of rows matches that in original dataset

#Rename column
BBmerged = BBmerged %>% rename(Beer_name = Name.x, Brewery_name = Name.y)

#Print first six
head(BBmerged)
#Print the last six
tail(BBmerged)

#Check for missing values
gg_miss_var(BBmerged)
```



QUESTION 3
Address the missing values in each column.

We tidied the data by removing the NULL values.
```{r}
#Remove missing values
gg_miss_var(BBmerged) #check for missing values
BBmergedclean = na.omit(BBmerged) #Removing missing values from data set
gg_miss_var(BBmergedclean) #Recheck for missing values
```



QUESTION 4
Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state.
Plot a bar chart to compare.

Looking at the bar charts it seems like Maine has the highest median ABV and IBU. We can draw more inferences by studying the bar plot. 
```{r}
#Median ABV and IBU per state
medABV_IBUperstate = BBmergedclean %>% group_by(State) %>% 
  summarise(MedianABV = median(ABV), MedianIBU = median(IBU)) #Get the Median ABV and IBU per state
medABV_IBUperstate

#Barplot of median ABV per state
medABV_IBUperstate %>% ggplot(aes(State, MedianABV)) + geom_col(color = "blue") +
  labs(y = "Median ABV", title = "Median Alcohol by Volume per State") +
  geom_text(aes(label = MedianABV), color = "blue", vjust = -0.5) + theme_fivethirtyeight()

#Barplot of median IBU per state
medABV_IBUperstate %>% ggplot(aes(State, MedianIBU)) + geom_col(color = "red") +
  labs(y = "Median IBU", title = "Median International Bitter Unit per State") +
  geom_text(aes(label = MedianIBU), color = "red", vjust = -0.5) + theme_economist()
```



QUESTION 5
Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

Using the original data set we found that the state with the highest Alcoholic Beverage by Volume (ABV) beer is Colorado.
The beer is called Lee Hill Series Vol. 5 - Belgian Style Quadrupel Ale having a ABV of 0.128.
We also found that the state with the highest International Bitterness Unit (IBU) beer is Oregon.
The beer is called Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA and has an IBU of 138.
```{r}
#State with maximum ABV
Beersabvclean = BBmerged %>% drop_na(ABV) #Remove missing ABV values
gg_miss_var(Beersabvclean) #Verify that there are no missing ABV values
Beersabvclean[Beersabvclean$ABV == max(Beersabvclean$ABV),] #See state with max ABV

#State with maximum IBU
Beersibuclean = BBmerged %>% drop_na(IBU) #Remove missing IBU values
gg_miss_var(Beersibuclean) #Verify that there are no missing IBU values
Beersibuclean[Beersibuclean$IBU == max(Beersibuclean$IBU),] #See state with max IBU
```



QUESTION 6
Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

We can see from the data that the median of the ABV in beers in the US is around 0.056 and the  minimum is 0.001 and the maximum is around 0.128. Looking at the box plot we can see that it is normally distributed.
```{r}
#See summary statistics of ABV
summary(BBmerged$ABV)
#See distribution of ABV
BBmerged %>% ggplot(aes(y = ABV)) + geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Alcohol by Volume Distribution")
```



QUESTION 7
Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

There is a positive correlation between IBU and ABV. The correlation is strongest between the two when ABV is between 0.05 and 0.075. 
```{r}
#Scatter plot of relationship between ABV and IBU
BBmergedclean %>% ggplot(aes(ABV, IBU)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + ggtitle("Beer IBU vs ABV")
```



QUESTION 8
Investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA). Use KNN classification to investigate this relationship. Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. 

Using the KNN classifier model we are able to predict whether a beer is a IPA or other Ale with 88.7% accuracy.We can see a relationship between IPA and other ales.
```{r}
BBipa = BBmergedclean %>% filter(str_detect(Style, regex("(IPA)", ignore_case = F))) #Create data set with just IPA
head(BBipa) #Verify data set
BBale = BBmergedclean %>% filter(str_detect(Style, regex("(Ale)", ignore_case = F))) #Create data set with jus Ale
head(BBale) #Verify data set

BBipa$Classifier = c('IPA') #Create column classifying everything as IPA
BBale$Classifier = c('Ale') #Create a column classifying everything as Ale

bbipa_ale = merge(BBipa, BBale, all = T) #Merge both data sets
head(bbipa_ale) #Veryfy data set 


#Average KNN to find the best K
splitPerc = .75
iterations = 500
numks = 30
masterAcc = matrix(nrow = iterations, ncol = numks)

for(j in 1:iterations)
{
  accs = data.frame(accuracy = numeric(30), k = numeric(30))
  trainIndices = sample(1:dim(bbipa_ale)[1],round(splitPerc * dim(bbipa_ale)[1]))
  train = bbipa_ale[trainIndices,]
  test = bbipa_ale[-trainIndices,]
  for(i in 1:numks)
  {
    classifications = knn(train[,c(4,5)],test[,c(4,5)],train$Classifier, prob = TRUE, k = i)
    table(classifications,test$Classifier)
    CM = confusionMatrix(table(classifications,test$Classifier))
    masterAcc[j,i] = CM$overall[1]
  }
}
MeanAcc = colMeans(masterAcc)
plot(seq(1,numks,1),MeanAcc, type = "l")


#See Confusion Matrix
classifications = knn(train[,c(4,5)],test[,c(4,5)],train$Classifier, prob = TRUE, k = 5)
table(classifications,test$Classifier)
CM = confusionMatrix(table(classifications,test$Classifier))
CM
```



QUESTION 9
Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in.  You must convince them why it is important and back up your conviction with appropriate statistical evidence.

We grouped each beer in to five categories based on their ounces for further analysis and plotted a bar chart. Looking at the bar chart we can see that the most common beer bottle size in most states is the Stubby which ranges from 11 to 12 ounces. Some states such as Indiana and Michigan seem to have more of the Long Neck/Heritage beer size which ranges from 12 to 22 ounces. In every state the least available beer bottle size seemed to be the Bomber which ranges from 22 to 32 ounces. This information can help guide future beer launches and what sizes to prioritize in what locations.
```{r}
#Create new categorical column for bottle sizes
BBmerged = BBmerged %>% mutate(Use = cut(Ounces, breaks = c(8,11,12,22,32,63),
                                         labels = c("Can", "Stubby", "Long Neck/Heritage", "Bomber", "Mini-Growler")))

BBmerged = BBmerged %>% rename(Size = Use) #Rename Column

#Bar chart of Bottle sizes by state
BBmerged %>% ggplot(aes(State, fill = Size)) + geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Bottle Sizes by State", x = "State", y = "Bottle Size") + theme_economist()
```
